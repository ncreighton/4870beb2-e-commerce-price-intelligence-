# E-commerce Price Intelligence and Competitor Tracking API

> REST API for e-commerce businesses monitoring competitor pricing and optimising their own price positioning. Accepts a product URL or ASIN and returns current competitor prices across Amazon, eBay, Walmart, and direct-to-consumer sites. Calculates your price index relative to market average and recommends a target price based on your margin floor and competitive tier. Sends webhook alerts when a tracked competitor drops price by more than 5 percent. Supports bulk price monitoring for up to 10000 SKUs, historical price chart data for 90 days, and MAP violation detection for brand manufacturers managing authorised dealer networks.
